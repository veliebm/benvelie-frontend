# Attributions

The inspiration for the squeaker toy on this website came from playing around with [the roingus project](https://github.com/SplitPixl/roingus), which is licensed under the Apache 2 license. Signficant changes I've made from that project include but are not limited to:
- Integrating it into a larger site
- Adding a backend and some persistent features
- Changing the theme and some features
