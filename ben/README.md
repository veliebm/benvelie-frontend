# Summary

This is a cute little squeaker toy. It connects to a backend to store some persistent data.

The inspiration for this toy came from playing around with http://roing.us. The [roingus project](https://github.com/SplitPixl/roingus) is licensed under the Apache 2 license. I have used its code liberally here. Signficant changes I've made from that project include but are not limited to:
- Integrating it into a larger site
- Adding a backend and some persistent features
- Changing the theme
- Removing some features
